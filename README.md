### ⚠ WARNING ⚠
**USING THIS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED CHEATING! IF YOU GET IN TROUBLE FOR USING THIS IT'S NOT MY FAULT.** Please do not use this unless you have extreme anxiety and depression from IXL, like most people.

### DO NOT EXPECT ME TO FINISH THIS
I'll probably get bored eventually and move on to some other project so yeah.

# ANTIxl
Pronounced "ANT - I.X.L"
<p align="center"><img src="img/ANTIxl.gif" width="700"/></p>
This is a program that helps you do IXL. Basically it makes it so you can't lose SmartScore points or whatever they're called by giving you infinite tries on each question. This is nowhere near finished.

### NOTE:
This is a very unprofessional GitHub repository. If you have any complaints, I'm too lazy so I probably won't do anything about it.

## If you don't know what any of this means
All you need to know is it is not finished and that it doesn't do the questions for you, it just makes it so you can't lose points.

## RELEASE INFORMATION
### Versions
 - VERSION 0.1 [pre-release]: Not very useful. Only works on one lesson, and only on half of the questions, but it works!

## ABOUT IXL
IXL is a website that helps schools with extra practice in subjects like math, reading, and other things. The problem with IXL is that it's more unforgiving than Dark Souls and Elden Ring and basically any other FromSoftware game. It's not fun either. You get one question wrong, you have to answer 10 more to get back to where you were. This program helps by not solving the problem for you, but giving you infinite tries on each question so that you don't have to lose progress.

## THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR FINISHED
This project is a work in progress. It is not currently usable. A new version will be added to "Releases" once a usable version comes out.
